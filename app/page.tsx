                    Since at least 2017, the Bath Bursary has been losing value to inflation. This year marks
                    not only a 20% decrease in the original bursary&apos;s effective value, but new effort from the
                    University
                    to further that trend to a tune of an overall <b>47%</b> decrease since 2017.

                        Through diverting cash funds from the bursary into food and drink credits, the university is
                        removing the choice from students on how they spend their money. This is not only unsustainable
                        but also unfair to students who rely on the bursary to make ends meet.

                    <p>
                        The Student Union at a SUmmit event outlined dishonesty in the university&apos;s approach to the
                        bursary, by forcing students to spend their bursary on food and drink credits that goes directly
                        back into the university&apos;s pocket. They further noted issues with those that have dietary
                        requirements
                        and the lack of variety in affordable food options.

                        Sustainable support does not look like cutting the value of the bursary and forcing students to
                        spend
                        it on food and drink credits. The university needs to be held accountable for its actions and
                        provide sustainable support for students in need.

                    <p>
                        The university must understand that the bursary is a lifeline for many students and that it is
                        unacceptable to cut its value. The university must provide sustainable support for students in
                        need.
